    "### Q-4. A group of 20 friends decide to play a game in which they each write a number between 1 and 20 on a slip of paper and put it into a hat. They then draw one slip of paper at random. What is the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16)?"

    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability that the number drawn from the hat is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, or 16), we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total no.of possible Outcomes:\n",
    "Since there are 20 slips of paper in the hat, each with a distinct number from 1 to 20, the total number of possible outcomes is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "no.of favorable Outcomes:\n",
    "Out of the 20 numbers, there are four perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, and 16. These are the favorable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability:\n",
    "The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability = no.of favorable outcomes / Total no.of possible putcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability = 4 (No.of favorable outcomes) / 20 (Total no.of possible outcomes)\n",
    "            = 1/5\n",
    "            = 0.2\n",
    "            = 20%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that the number drawn from the hat is a perfect square is 20%."
