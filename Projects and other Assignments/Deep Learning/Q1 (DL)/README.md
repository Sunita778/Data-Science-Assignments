### Problem Statement:
Implement 3 different CNN architectures with a comparison table for the MNSIT
dataset using the Tensorflow library.

Note -

1. The model parameters for each architecture should not be more than 8000
parameters
2. Code comments should be given for proper code understanding.
3. The minimum accuracy for each accuracy should be at least 96%
