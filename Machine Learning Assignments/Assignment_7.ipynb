The target function represents the relationship between the input variables and the output variables that the algorithm is trying to capture.\n",

    "For example, let's say we want to build a model to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, the square footage, and the location of the house. The target function in this case would be a mathematical function that takes these input variables as its input and predicts the price of the house as its output.\n",

    "The fitness of a target function is typically assessed by comparing its predictions to the actual values in the training data. This is done by defining a loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output for a given input. The goal of the machine learning algorithm is to find the target function that minimizes the loss function on the training data, which should result in good performance on new, unseen data. Different machine learning algorithms may use different loss functions and optimization techniques to find the target function that best fits the training data."

A model with high variance is too complex and fits the noise in the training data, resulting in overfitting.
