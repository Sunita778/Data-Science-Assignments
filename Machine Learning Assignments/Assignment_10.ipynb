    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability views probability as a measure of belief or uncertainty rather than a measure of long-term frequencies. It considers probability as a subjective assessment based on available evidence and prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interpretation, probabilities are assigned to propositions or hypotheses based on an individual's beliefs. These probabilities can be updated as new evidence is obtained using Bayes' theorem, which mathematically describes how prior beliefs are combined with new information to form updated beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian approach recognizes that people can have different degrees of belief and allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge or assumptions. It provides a framework for reasoning under uncertainty and making probabilistic predictions or decisions based on the available evidence."

    "The equation takes into account the probabilities of each event individually (P(A) and P(B)) and subtracts the probability of their intersection (P(A ∩ B) to avoid double counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "By subtracting the probability of the intersection, the equation accounts for the fact that when both events A and B occur, their intersection is counted twice when considering the individual probabilities. Hence, subtracting P(A ∩ B) ensures that the correct probability of the union of events A and B is calculated."
