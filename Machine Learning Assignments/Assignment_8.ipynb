    "Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design and train better features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering in ML consists of four main steps: Feature Creation, Transformations, Feature Extraction, and Feature Selection. Feature engineering consists of creation, transformation, extraction, and selection of features, also known as variables, that are most conducive to creating an accurate ML algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a look at some Feature Engineering Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imputation: Imputation deals with handling missing values in data.\n",
    "Discretization/Binning: Discretization involves essentially taking a set of values of data and grouping sets of them together in some logical fashion into bins (or buckets).\n",
    "- Caategorical Encoding: Categorical encoding is the technique used to encode categorical features into numerical values which are usually simpler for an algorithm to understand. One hot encoding(OHE) is a popularly used technique of categorical encoding. Here, categorical values are converted into simple numerical 1’s and 0’s without the loss of information.\n",
    "- Feature Splitting: Splitting features into parts can sometimes improve the value of the features toward the target to be learned. For instance, Date might better contribute to the target function than Date and Time.\n",
    "- Handling Outliers: Outliers are unusually high or low values in the dataset which are unlikely to occur in normal scenarios. Since these outliers could adversely affect your prediction they must be handled appropriately. The various methods of handling outliers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Removal: The records containing outliers are removed from the distribution. However, the presence of outliers over multiple variables could result in losing out on a large portion of the datasheet with this method. b) Replacing values: The outliers could alternatively bed treated as missing values and replaced by using appropriate imputation. c) Capping: Capping the maximum and minimum values and replacing them with an arbitrary value or a value from a variable distribution. d) Discretization 6. Scaling: Feature scaling is done owing to the sensitivity of some machine learning algorithms to the scale of the input values. This technique of feature scaling is sometimes referred to as feature normalization. The commonly used processes of scaling include: a) Min-Max Scaling: This process involves the rescaling of all values in a feature in the range 0 to 1. In other words, the minimum value in the original range will take the value 0, the maximum value will take 1 and the rest of the values in between the two extremes will be appropriately scaled. b) Standardization/Variance scaling: All the data points are subtracted by their mean and the result divided by the distribution's variance to arrive at a distribution with a 0 mean and variance of 1. 7. Variable Transformation: Variable transformation techniques could help with normalizing skewed data. One such popularly used transformation is the logarithmic transformation. Logarithmic transformations operate to compress the larger numbers and relatively expand the smaller numbers. This in turn results in less skewed values especially in the case of heavy-tailed distributions. Other variable transformations used include Square root transformation and Box cox transformation which is a generalization of the former two. 8. Feature Creation: Feature creation involves deriving new features from existing ones. This can be done by simple mathematical operations such as aggregations to obtain the mean, median, mode, sum, or difference and even product of two values. These features, although derived directly from the given data, when carefully chosen to relate to the target can have an impact on the performance\n",

    "Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of the original features from a dataset that are most relevant to the problem at hand. The aim of feature selection is to reduce the complexity of the dataset by removing redundant, irrelevant or noisy features, which can improve the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea behind feature selection is to rank the importance of each feature based on a specific criterion or metric and select only the top-ranked features. There are various methods for feature selection, some of the most commonly used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filter methods: This method ranks the features based on their statistical properties such as correlation, mutual information, chi-squared test, etc. and selects the top-ranked features. This method is computationally inexpensive and works well when the features are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrapper methods: This method selects the features based on their predictive power by using a machine learning algorithm to evaluate subsets of features. The algorithm is trained on subsets of features and evaluated on a validation set to determine the best subset of features. This method is computationally expensive, but it can find the optimal subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embedded methods: This method selects the features during the training of the machine learning algorithm. The algorithm automatically selects the most relevant features while training the model, by penalizing or rewarding the importance of each feature. This method is computationally efficient and works well when the features are strongly related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of the most appropriate method depends on the size and complexity of the dataset, the number of features, and the nature of the problem. The ultimate goal of feature selection is to improve the accuracy and generalization of the model while reducing its complexity, making it easier to interpret and understand."

    "Nominal variables are categorical variables that have no intrinsic order or ranking, and their values cannot be quantified numerically. Examples of nominal variables include gender, race, religion, or type of car.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use nominal variables in a machine learning model, they need to be encoded into a numerical format. There are several methods to encode nominal variables, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-Hot Encoding: This method creates a binary feature for each category in the nominal variable. For example, suppose we have a nominal variable \"Color\" with categories red, blue, and green. In that case, we create three binary features: Color_red, Color_blue, and Color_green. If an instance has a red color, the Color_red feature is set to 1, and the others are set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Label Encoding: This method assigns a numerical value to each category in the nominal variable. For example, suppose we have a nominal variable \"Gender\" with categories Male and Female. In that case, we can assign Male=0 and Female=1. However, it is essential to note that there is no intrinsic order to the values assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Binary Encoding: This method creates a binary representation of each category using a sequence of bits. For example, suppose we have a nominal variable \"Color\" with categories red, blue, and green. In that case, we can encode red as 001, blue as 010, and green as 100. This encoding can help reduce the number of features needed compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of encoding method depends on the nature of the nominal variable and the machine learning algorithm being used. One-hot encoding is the most common encoding method for nominal variables because it preserves the categorical nature of the variable and avoids any ordinal assumptions. However, if the number of categories is high, it can lead to the curse of dimensionality. Label encoding can be used when the categories have a natural ordering, but it may not be appropriate when no order exists. Binary encoding is a compromise between one-hot encoding and label encoding and can be useful when the number of categories is relatively large."

    "Numeric features are quantitative variables that have numerical values and can be ordered or ranked. Examples of numeric features include age, income, weight, height, or temperature. Sometimes it may be necessary to convert numeric features into categorical features to better represent the data and create more meaningful subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common method for converting numeric features to categorical features is called binning or discretization. Binning involves dividing the range of numeric values into a set of discrete intervals or bins and then assigning a categorical label to each interval. There are two types of binning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equal Width Binning: This method divides the range of values into a fixed number of equally sized bins. For example, if we want to convert age to a categorical variable, we could divide the range of values into five bins of equal width: [0-20), [20-40), [40-60), [60-80), and [80-100].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Equal Frequency Binning: This method divides the range of values into a fixed number of bins, each containing an equal number of instances. For example, if we want to convert income to a categorical variable, we could divide the range of values into five bins of equal frequency, such as low, medium-low, medium, medium-high, and high.\n",
    "\n",
    "After binning, we can assign a categorical label to each bin. The labels can be either ordinal or nominal, depending on the nature of the problem. For example, if we divide the age feature into five bins, we could assign an ordinal label such as \"youngest,\" \"young,\" \"middle-aged,\" \"old,\" and \"oldest.\" Alternatively, we could assign a nominal label such as \"age group 1,\" \"age group 2,\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of binning method and the number of bins depends on the distribution of the data and the specific problem at hand. Binning can help to reduce the effects of outliers and improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms, especially those that work better with categorical features. However, binning can also result in the loss of information and granularity, and it is not always the best solution for every problem."

    "The feature selection wrapper approach is a method for selecting the most relevant subset of features from a dataset. It is called a wrapper because it involves evaluating the performance of a machine learning model by iteratively selecting and testing subsets of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps of the wrapper approach are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select an initial subset of features.\n",
    "2. Train a machine learning model on the subset of features.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the performance of the model using a validation set.\n",
    "4. If the performance is satisfactory, stop. Otherwise, repeat steps 1-3 with a different subset of features until a satisfactory performance is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wrapper approach is called a \"wrapper\" because it wraps the machine learning model around the feature selection process. This approach has some advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The wrapper approach considers the interaction between features, which can result in more accurate feature selection compared to filter or embedded approaches.\n",
    "- It can improve the performance of a machine learning model by selecting only the most relevant features.\n",
    "- It is flexible and can be used with any machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The wrapper approach is computationally expensive because it involves training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.\n",
    "- It can overfit the model to the training data if the feature selection process is not properly validated.\n",
    "- The wrapper approach can be sensitive to the choice of algorithm and hyperparameters used in the feature selection process.\n",

    "Despite its disadvantages, the wrapper approach is a powerful method for feature selection, especially when used with small or noisy datasets. It can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data, improve the interpretability of the model, and reduce the risk of overfitting. However, it is important to use the wrapper approach with care and validate the feature selection process to ensure that it is not biased or overfitted to the training data."

    "A feature is considered irrelevant when it does not contribute any useful information to the predictive model or when its contribution is negligible compared to other features. An irrelevant feature may also introduce noise or increase the complexity of the model without improving its accuracy.\n",

    "A feature is considered redundant when it does not provide any additional information that is not already captured by other features in the dataset. In other words, a redundant feature does not contribute to the prediction performance of a model and can be safely removed without affecting the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify features that could be redundant, several criteria can be used, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlation: Features that have a high correlation with each other may be redundant because they capture similar information. A high correlation between two features suggests that one of the features could be removed without significantly affecting the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Information gain: Features that provide similar information gain or have a similar relationship with the target variable may be redundant. Information gain measures how much a feature reduces the uncertainty about the target variable. If two features provide similar information gain, one of them may be redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the most important features that explain the variance in the data. Features that have low weights in the principal components may be redundant.\n",

    "In practice, a combination of these criteria can be used to identify redundant features. Removing redundant features can help simplify the model, reduce the risk of overfitting, and speed up the training process. However, it is important to note that removing features can also result in a loss of information or bias the model, so it is important to validate the performance of the model after feature removal."
