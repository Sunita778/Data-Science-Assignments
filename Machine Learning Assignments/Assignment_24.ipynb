    "\n",
    "- `K-means clustering`: A popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data points into K clusters based on their proximity to K cluster centroids.\n",

    "- `Hierarchical clustering`: A method that creates a hierarchy of nested clusters by repeatedly merging or splitting clusters based on their similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)`: A density-based algorithm that groups data points based on their density and identifies outliers as noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Gaussian mixture models`: A probabilistic clustering algorithm that assumes the data is generated by a mixture of Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Agglomerative clustering`: A bottom-up hierarchical clustering algorithm that starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges the most similar clusters iteratively until a stopping criterion is met."

It involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters, and looking for an elbow point in the curve where the rate of decrease in WCSS starts to level off. The elbow point represents the optimal number of clusters, where adding more clusters does not result in a significant decrease in WCSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Silhouette Method*: The silhouette method is another approach for selecting the appropriate number of clusters in K-Means. It involves computing the silhouette coefficient for each data point, which measures how well the data point is clustered with its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher value indicates better clustering. The average silhouette coefficient for each cluster is then computed, and the optimal number of clusters is chosen based on the maximum average silhouette coefficient.\n"

    "Mark propagation is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method that propagates class labels or cluster assignments from labeled data points to unlabeled data points in the graph, based on their similarity or proximity. It can be useful when we have limited labeled data and want to leverage the information from the unlabeled data to improve classification or clustering performance. To perform mark propagation, we construct a graph representation of the data, assign initial labels or assignments to the labeled data points, and propagate them to the unlabeled data points using a graph-based diffusion algorithm. Mark propagation requires careful tuning of the graph construction and diffusion parameters and sufficient labeled data points to ensure the quality of the propagated labels."

These algorithms can be useful for updating the model without retraining from scratch and detecting evolving patterns in the data."

Understanding the difference between the two approaches can help us choose the appropriate technique for a given problem and evaluate the performance of the detection task."

To work with Gaussian mixture models, one can use various libraries and tools available in programming languages like Python, R, or Matlab. Some popular libraries include scikit-learn, TensorFlow Probability, and Pyro."

The model with the lowest AIC value is considered the best fit.\n",
