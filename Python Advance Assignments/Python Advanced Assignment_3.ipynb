    "An abstract superclass is a class in object-oriented programming that cannot be instantiated directly but is meant to be inherited by its subclasses. Abstract superclasses are also known as abstract classes or abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is typically used to define a common interface or behavior that is shared by a group of related classes. The abstract superclass defines the methods and properties that its subclasses must implement, but it does not provide an implementation of those methods itself. Instead, the subclasses are responsible for providing their own implementations of the abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of an abstract superclass is to provide a framework for defining related classes with a common set of properties and methods. This can help to reduce redundancy in the code and make it easier to maintain and extend the code over time."

This means that if a function defines a variable with the same name as a variable defined in the global scope, the function's variable will take precedence. In a class, however, the class's scope takes precedence over the local scope of any method or function defined within the class.\n",
