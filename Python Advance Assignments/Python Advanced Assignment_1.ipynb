    "The purpose of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is to provide a way to organize code into reusable and modular structures. OOP allows you to define classes and objects, which can encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to build complex software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, we can define classes that encapsulate data and behavior, which can then be instantiated as objects. These objects can interact with one another to perform complex operations and provide abstraction, making it easier to build and maintain software systems. OOP also provides inheritance and polymorphism, which allow you to create new classes that inherit attributes and behavior from existing classes, and to create objects that can be treated as instances of multiple types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the use of OOP in Python is to help developers write more maintainable, scalable, and flexible code, by breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces and providing abstractions that make it easier to reason about the code and reuse it across multiple projects."

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, inheritance searches for an attribute start with the object's class and then proceed up the chain of parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program tries to access an attribute of an object, Python first looks for the attribute in the object's class. If the attribute is not found in the class, Python will then look in the parent class, and so on, until it reaches the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is known as the method resolution order (MRO), and it determines the order in which Python will search for an attribute in the parent classes. In Python, the MRO is determined by the C3 linearization algorithm, which provides a deterministic and efficient way of resolving method calls in a multiple inheritance scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the attribute is not found in any of the parent classes, Python will raise an AttributeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, inheritance in Python provides a mechanism for creating objects that inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes, allowing you to build complex systems from simpler components and to create reusable code."

If not, it's an instance object. Another way is to check the presence of the '__class__' attribute. An instance object has a '__class__' attribute that references its class, while a class object does not have an instance."
