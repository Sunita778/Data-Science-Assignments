    "Classes and modules are both used to organize and structure code in Python. A module is a single Python file that can contain functions, variables, and classes, while a class is a blueprint for creating objects, which can have attributes and methods.\n",

    "A class can be defined within a module, making it accessible to other parts of the code within the same module. When the module is imported into another script, the classes defined within the module can be used within the importing script. This allows for code reuse and organization, as related classes can be grouped together within a single module."

    "In Python, operator overloading is a way to define the behavior of operators (such as +, -, *, /, <, >, etc.) for custom classes. This means that when we apply an operator to an instance of a class, Python will call a method on that instance that is associated with the operator being used.\n",

    "To overload an operator, we can define a special method in our class that corresponds to the operator we want to overload. For example, to overload the + operator, we can define a method named \"add\" in our class. The method should take two arguments: self (the instance on the left side of the operator) and other (the instance on the right side of the operator). The method should return the result of the operation."
