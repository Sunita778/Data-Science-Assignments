    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `bytes` objects represent sequences of `bytes` and support operations that are more relevant to binary data, such as searching for byte patterns, replacing byte patterns, and splitting `bytes` into smaller chunks. `bytes` objects can also be compared and concatenated with other `bytes` objects.\n",

    "While there is some overlap in the operations that can be performed on `str` and `bytes` objects, it's important to use the appropriate type depending on the nature of the data being processed.
