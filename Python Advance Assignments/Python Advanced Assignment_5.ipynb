    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages, such as Python, that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. In other words, a class can have multiple superclasses, each providing a set of attributes and methods that the subclass can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it inherits all the attributes and methods of each parent class. This can lead to a complex hierarchy of classes, with methods and attributes potentially being overridden or conflicting with each other. To handle these conflicts, Python follows a specific method resolution order (MRO) that determines the order in which parent classes are searched for attributes and methods."
