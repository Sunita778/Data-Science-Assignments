The goal of descriptive statistics is to provide a concise and meaningful summary of a dataset that allows you to understand the data and get a general idea of what the data looks like.\n",

    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, go beyond the data and make inferences about a larger population based on a sample of data. In other words, inferential statistics use the information in a sample to make estimates and predictions about the population. The goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions and make decisions about the population based on the sample data.\n",

    "The difference between a sample and a population is important in statistics because the sample is used to make inferences about the population. The sample must be selected in a way that is representative of the population, so that the results of the study are representative of the population as a whole. If the sample is not representative, the inferences made from the sample may not be accurate."

It provides a concise and meaningful summary of a dataset, allowing you to understand the data and get a general idea of what the data looks like. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from other types of statistics in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: The main purpose of descriptive statistics is to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, while other types of statistics may have different goals such as making inferences, testing hypotheses, or making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approach: Descriptive statistics uses methods such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, standard deviation), and frequency distributions to summarize and describe the data. Other types of statistics may use different methods, such as inferential statistics which uses probability theory and statistical models to make inferences about populations based on sample data.\n",

    "- Nature of data: Descriptive statistics is typically used for datasets that have already been collected, while other types of statistics may be used for datasets that have not yet been collected or for the purpose of designing studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, descriptive statistics is distinguished from other types of statistics by its focus on summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset, its approach using methods such as measures of central tendency and variability, and its typical use for datasets that have already been collected."

    "Quantitative data is numerical data that can be measured and compared. Examples of quantitative data include height, weight, income, temperature, and time. Quantitative data is often used to answer questions about how much or how many, and it can be analyzed using mathematical and statistical methods.\n",

    "Qualitative data, on the other hand, is non-numerical data that describes qualities or characteristics. Examples of qualitative data include names, opinions, attitudes, beliefs, and emotions. Qualitative data is often used to answer questions about why or how something happened, and it can be analyzed using methods such as observation, interviews, and content analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, quantitative data is numerical and focuses on measurement, while qualitative data is non-numerical and focuses on describing qualities and characteristics. Both types of data are important in different ways, and they are often used together to provide a complete understanding of a phenomenon."

In other words, 90% of the students scored below this value, and 10% of the students scored above it. If the 90th percentile score was 80, this would mean that 90 students scored 80 or lower, and 10 students scored higher than 80."
